# LLM-Fine-tuning-Impression-Generation-5C-network-assignment
In this project, I fine-tuned a GPT-2 model on a medical text dataset to help it generate more relevant and coherent impressions from medical histories and observations. The results were promising! The model produced text that closely mirrored the style and structure of the input data, making it a useful tool for generating medical insights.
